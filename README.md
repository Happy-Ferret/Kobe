An abandoned point and click adventure game (like Monkey Island) for DOS. It implements VGA at 320x240 (Abrash Mode-X), scrolling and a primitive renderer. Compiles to real mode DOS and do not uses more that 640k of memory, so technically should works on a original 386 at 16 MHz.

Of course on its unfinished state is more like an engine that a game.
